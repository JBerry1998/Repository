Safety Policy

Safety Procedures
A procedure sets out the steps to be followed for work activities.  
A procedure will document and list all hazards with a certain work task.  This will then inform
employees of the steps needed to safely complete the task, including protective equipment required.
According to the Health and Safety Executive, there are over 150,000 injuries in the workplace each year in the UK.
Typical health and safety policy and procedures should include:
·        All risks present in your workplace
·       Staff training
·       The must be enough emergency exits for everyone to escape quickly,
and they must not be obstructed
·       How you are managing any hazardous substances, equipment or
machinery?
·       The actions required to minimise risks
·       Whose responsibility is it to ensure these actions are taken
·       Who records incidents and tasks
·       What happens if there is incident? How will these be
managed and the effects minimised?
 

A bespoke health and safety agreement must be drawn up for the workplace for dangers and risks will not be identical between companies. 
Employers have a duty of care towards their employees to ensure their health and safety at the workplace are respected, managed and provided for.
