Part B (2 marks out of 10):
This extract is taken from a discussion paper on the use of Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) within the curriculum.

For some time, it has been part of our school policy to include ICT throughout
the curriculum, providing that it makes a direct and useful contribution to the
subject(s) and to each pupil’s learning. In order to implement the policy, we
need to review how ICT is currently used and, in particular, ask:
•	How can software be assessed, and by whom?
•	Is there any hardware that is currently under-used?
•	Is there any software that is currently under-used?
•	__________
1.	Where in the curriculum do students currently gain ICT experience?
2.	Where in the curriculum was students currently gaining ICT experience?
3.	Where in the curriculum has students currently gained ICT experience?
4.	Where in the curriculum will ICT experience currently be gained by the students?

The school also needs to ask, ‘How is ICT placed within the school
development plan and cycle of review?’
For ICT resources to be used effectively to support your subject, you need to
be clear about how and why you wish to use them. A review will provide __________
1.	an opportunity for clarifying your needs and goals and consider existing practice.
2.	an opportunity to clarify your needs and goals and consider existing practice.
3.	an opportunity to clarify your needs and goals and considering existing practice.
4.	an opportunity for clarification of your needs and goals and consider existing practice.

The successful integration of ICT will enhance pupils’ interest and skills and may lead to new initiatives with other departments.

Comprehension (10 marks):
Read the extract below, and then answer the 4 (A to D) multiple choice questions.

The following extract is from the Times Educational Supplement,
January 2001.
A recent analysis of tests has found that junior boys have made a marked
improvement in their spelling and have caught up with girls. But significant
numbers of 11-YEAR-OLD boys and girls are still struggling with everyday words.
The analysis by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, shows that Key
Stage 2 pupils spelt 93% of words correctly. The improvement is due to boys’
more accurate spelling. There was also a marked improvement in younger
children’s spelling. However, more than half of the 600,000 pupils who took
the tests will go on to secondary schools unable to spell words like necessary,
extremely, pollution, pierce and structures. 80% of 11-YEAR-OLDS failed to spell
environment. Many pupils who reached the required standard in English still
struggled to cope with words such as passenger and generation.
Despite the spelling shortcomings, standards in literacy continue to improve.
The proportion of 11-YEAR-OLDS reaching the expected mark rose steadily from
64% in 1992 to 75% in 2000. The government’s target is now 85%. Although
boys’ reading has improved slightly over the past two years, girls continue to
beat them. Just over half of students tested are writing at a level
commensurate with Key Stage 2 standards. The National Primary Heads’
Association commented that the results showed that schools had really put
time into motivating boys with reading, writing and spelling.
The underlying causes of boys’ underachievement in the past have been
widely debated. When thinking about and taking action, it is important to
recognise boys’ strengths and build on them. When their interest is engaged,
boys can work with great efficiency. They prioritise well, respond to clearly set
tasks with well-defined outcomes and benefit from strong and enthusiastic
teaching. It has also been observed that boys generally have a shorter
concentration span than girls and are more likely to be found ‘off-task’. They
find it hard to be quietly reflective. However, although boys recognise the
importance of academic success, there is an inverse culture that acts as a
deterrent to hard work or enthusiasm. Boys gain little credibility among their
peers by being seen to be successful. 
Powerful forces, largely beyond the control of teachers, may shape attitudes
towards learning, literacy and behaviour. This needs to be acknowledged but
it is also important to concentrate on those factors that are within teachers’
control. The culture, which effectively makes a virtue of underachievement,
is a crucial factor in boys’ performance. Any educational counteraction must
benefit all pupils. Work to improve boys’ achievements must not be at the
expense of girls’. Whatever happens outside, schools can make a difference.
These results show that teachers have a major influence on the attitudes,
success or failure of their pupils.
